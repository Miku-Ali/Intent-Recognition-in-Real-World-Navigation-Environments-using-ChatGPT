# Intent-Recognition-in-Real-World-Navigation-Environments-using-ChatGPT
The aim of the project is to develop goal recognition techniques using ChatGPT.  It is also expected to experiment and evaluate the implemented techniques over real-world navigation environments, such as Google Maps (by observing the agents by car).

The inputs of experiments are the origins, mutiple destinations and  sequences of observation points

The output are the accuracies of googlemap, Large language model and mapbox as goal recognition

This experiment will test the ability of Large Language Model as goal recognition
