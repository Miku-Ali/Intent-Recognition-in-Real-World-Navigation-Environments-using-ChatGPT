# Intent-Recognition-in-Real-World-Navigation-Environments-using-ChatGPT
The aim of the project is to develop goal recognition techniques using ChatGPT [3].  It is also expected to experiment and evaluate the implemented techniques over real-world navigation environments, such as Google Maps (by observing the agents by bike, on foot, and by car).
